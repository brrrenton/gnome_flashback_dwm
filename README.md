# Gnome Flashback with DWM

* The package "gnome-flashback" is required (but not "gnome-session-flashback")
* "dwm.sh" also runs:
  * hsetroot
  * numlockx
  * status.py
* Disable the desktop background and icons with ```gsettings set org.gnome.gnome-flashback desktop false```
* Disable notifications with ```gsettings set org.gnome.gnome-flashback notifications false```
* These files were created by copying and modifying the Metacity Gnome Flashback session files, and the "i3-gnome" script from [i3-gnome](https://github.com/TheMarex/i3-gnome)

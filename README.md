# Gnome Flashback with DWM

* Requires the "gnome-flashback" package (but not the "gnome-session-flashback" package"), and assumes dwm and slstatus are installed
* These files were created by copying and modifying the Metacity Gnome Flashback session files, and the "i3-gnome" script from [i3-gnome](https://github.com/TheMarex/i3-gnome)
* Gnome Flashback can be further configured by modifying dconf settings in "/org/gnome/gnome-flashback" (e.g. "notifications" can be disabled to use Dunst)
